<div class="pl-5 pr-5 mb-5">
    <p>Passionate Software Engineer with a flair for putting users first and finding joy in the perfect line of code. Well-versed in Software Architecture and advocate for selective use of Domain-Driven Design, I also have a genuine fondness for crafting clear, understandable code. I see coding as an art form where every line tells its own story, blending functionality with clarity.</p>
    <p>Guiding development teams, I focus on cultivating an environment that encourages experimentation and innovation, by making sure that it is safe to make mistakes.</p>
    <p>If you're looking for someone who challenges the status quo and values constructive brainstorming, I'm your go-to.</p>
