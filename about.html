<div class="pl-5 pr-5 mb-5">
    <p>Passionate Software Engineer with a flair for putting users first and finding joy in the perfect line of code. Well-versed in Software Architecture and advocate for selective use of Domain-Driven Design, I also have a genuine fondness for crafting clear, understandable code. I see coding as an art form where every line tells its own story, blending functionality with clarity.</p>
    <p>Guiding development teams, I focus on cultivating an environment that encourages experimentation and innovation, by making sure that it is safe to make mistakes.</p>
    <p>My hiring strategy prioritizes cultural alignment, domain expertise, and technical skills, always with an eye on growth potential, for a versatile, forward-thinking team.</p>
    <p>I openly acknowledge knowledge gaps in Algorithms and Data Structures, System Design at Scale, Java Concurrency, Kafka Streams, gRPC, GraphQL, Kubernetes (beyond basics), and modern front-end tech. 2024 growth plan: Algorithms, Data Structures, and System Design.</p>
    <p>If you're looking for someone who challenges the status quo and values constructive brainstorming, I'm your go-to.</p>
